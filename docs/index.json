Our model allows one to freely vary the resonance frequency of the cavity, the frequency of light or atomic transition addressing it, and the design wavelength of the dielectric mirror. The coupling strength is derived for an open system with unbound frequency modes. For very short cavities, the effective length used to determine their mode volume and the lengths defining their resonances are different, and also found to diverge appreciably from their geometric length, with the radiation field being strongest within the dielectric mirror itself. Only for cavities much longer than their resonant wavelength does the mode volume asymptotically approach that normally assumed from their geometric length.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Light-matter interaction in open cavities with dielectric stacks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Rafael Álvarez","Samael Sarmiento","José A.

[Opt. Lett. 35(3), 312 (2010)] demonstrated a random number generator based on the drift of the phase of a laser due to spontaneous emission, The out-of-the-lab implementation of this scheme presents two main drawbacks: it requires a long and highly unbalanced interferometer to generate a random phase with uniform probability distribution, or alternatively, a shorter and slightly unbalanced interferometer that notwithstanding requires active stabilization and does not generate a uniform probability distribution without randomness extraction. Here we demonstrate that making use of the random nature of the phase difference between two independent laser sources and two coherent detectors we can overcome these limitations. The two main advantages of the system demonstrated are: i) it generates a probability distribution of quantum origin which is intrinsically uniform and thus in principle needs no randomness extraction for obtaining a uniform distribution, and ii) the phase is measured with telecom equipment routinely used for high capacity coherent optical communications. The speed of random bit generation is determined by the photodetector bandwidth and the linewidth of the lasers. As a by-product of our method, we have obtained images of how phase noise develops with time in a laser. This provides a highly visual alternative way of measuring the coherence time of a laser.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Random number generation by coherent detection of quantum phase noise","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel F.

The channel is implemented by coupling the polarization and the spatial distribution of light that play, in the perspective of open quantum systems, the role of quantum system and environment, respectively. The capability of controlling our channel allows us to visualize its effects in a quantum system. Different from standard dephasing channels, our channel presents an exotic behavior in the sense that the evolution of a state, from a pure to a mixed state, shows an oscillatory behavior if tracked in the Bloch sphere. Additionally, we report the evolution of the purity and perform a quantum process tomography to obtain the χ matrix associated to our channel.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Implementation and characterization of a controllable dephasing channel based on coupling polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of light","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jefferson Flórez","Juan Rafael Álvarez","Omar Calderón-Losada","Luis José Salazar-Serrano","Alejandra Valencia"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

This resembles the Alford and Gold effect that has been reported for the time-frequency degree of freedom, and constitutes a method for spatial intensity shaping of light beams. We observe this interference by using a tunable beam displacer, which plays the role of a Michelson interferometer for the transverse spatial variables. Additionally, we employ the interference pattern as a function of the separation between the beams to determine the spatial coherence length of the original beam.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Interference of two pulse-like spatial beams with arbitrary transverse separation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://juanralvarez.github.io/mypage/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mypage/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
