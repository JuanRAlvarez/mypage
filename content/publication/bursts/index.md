abstract: "Photonic qubits play an instrumental role in the development of advanced quantum technologies, including quantum networking, boson sampling and measurement based quantum computing. A promising framework for the deterministic production of indistinguishable single photons is an atomic emitter coupled to a single mode of a high finesse optical cavity. Polarisation control is an important cornerstone, particularly when the polarisation defines the state of a quantum bit. Here, we propose a scheme for producing bursts of polarised single photons by coupling a generalised atomic emitter to an optical cavity, exploiting a particular choice of quantisation axis. In connection with two re-preparation methods, simulations predict ten-photon bursts coincidence count rates on the order of 1â€‰kHz with single 87Rb atoms trapped in a state of the art optical cavity. This paves the way for novel n-photon experiments with atom-cavity sources."
