abstract: We evaluate the exact dipole coupling strength between a single emitter and the radiation field within an optical cavity. Our model allows one to freely vary the resonance frequency of the cavity, the frequency of light or atomic transition addressing it, and the design wavelength of the dielectric mirror. The coupling strength is derived for an open system with unbound frequency modes. For very short cavities, the effective length used to determine their mode volume and the lengths defining their resonances are different, and also found to diverge appreciably from their geometric length, with the radiation field being strongest within the dielectric mirror itself. Only for cavities much longer than their resonant wavelength does the mode volume asymptotically approach that normally assumed from their geometric length.
