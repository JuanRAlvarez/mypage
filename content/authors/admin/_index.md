I am interested in understanding the fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics, especially through experiments that involve the use of single photons. I am also interested in topics related to quantum information theory, quantum communications, quantum computing, nanophotonics, special functions, and asymptotic analysis. I am passionate about scientific outreach and teaching as tools to promote the personal development and academic empowerment of students.
