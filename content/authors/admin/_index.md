## About Me

I am a physicist interested in understanding quantum optical phenomena, especially through experiments that involve the use of light and matter. I am currently an assistant professor (maître de conférences) in the Optical Telecommunications Group (GTO) at Telecom Paris. Before this, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre de Nanosciences et Nanotechnologies (C2N) of the CNRS in Palaiseau, France, I graduated from a DPhil in Atomic and Laser Physics at the University of Oxford, and have performed a masters degree in Marseille and Barcelona, and Physics and Mathematics undergraduates at the Universidad de los Andes, in Bogotá, Colombia. I have also been a teacher, a scientific disseminator, and have made part of several associations to promote the knowledge of optics, photonics and quantum technologies.
