I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Centrer for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (C2N) in Palaiseau, France. I am interested in understanding the fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics through experiments that involve the use of single photons. I am also interested in topics related to quantum information theory, quantum communications, quantum computing and nanophotonics. I am passionate about scientific outreach and teaching as tools to promote the personal development and academic empowerment of students.
